    "It seems strange, right? We just used OpenAI code to call Ollama?? What's going on?!\n",

    "Here's the scoop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The python class `OpenAI` is simply code written by OpenAI engineers that makes calls over the internet to an endpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `openai.chat.completions.create()`, this python code just makes a web request to the following url: \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Code like this is known as a \"client library\" - it's just wrapper code that runs on your machine to make web requests. The actual power of GPT is running on OpenAI's cloud behind this API, not on your computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI was so popular, that lots of other AI providers provided identical web endpoints, so you could use the same approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Ollama has an endpoint running on your local box at http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions  \n",
    "And in week 2 we'll discover that lots of other providers do this too, including Gemini and DeepSeek.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the team at OpenAI had a great idea: they can extend their client library so you can specify a different 'base url', and use their library to call any compatible API.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you say: `ollama_via_openai = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')`  \n",
    "Then this will make the same endpoint calls, but to Ollama instead of OpenAI."
